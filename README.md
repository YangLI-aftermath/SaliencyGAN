# Paper
This repository provides the implementation of SaliencyGAN in the following paper: 

[**Saliencygan: Deep learning semi-supervised salient object detection in the fog of iot.**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8859383)

IEEE Transactions on Industial Informatics

# Tips: 
* Util package added.
* Some of loss functions are different from the paper: 
  * Wasserstein Distance deprecated.
  * Perceptual loss added.  
  * Cycle loss added.
* The network can be run on tensorflow 1.x.
